```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

# Create a Vector!
vec_a <- c(4,5)

```

### Another code chunk 

Anything you set in a code chunk's header overrides the global options. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vec_b <- c(-3,10)
```

## Vector Addition 

```{r}
vec_c <- vec_a + vec_b
```

## Vector Subtraction

```{r}
# vec_d is vec_b - -vec_a

vec_d <- vec_b - vec_a
```


## Vector Scalar Multiplier

```{r}
# what is vec_e is it is 4 * vec_b
vec_e <- 4 * vec_b
```

## If Dot Product were asterisk
It's NOT the dot product. Dot product has a weird symbol: %*% See below. 

```{r}
vec_a * vec_b

vec_a %*% vec_b
```
